### 18.7

Consider a database system that includes an atomic in
rement operation, in addition to the read and write operations. Let V be the value of data item X.
The operation


$$
increment(X) \ by \ C
$$

sets the value of $X$ to $V + C$ in an atomic step. The value of $X$ is not available
to the transaction unless the latter executes a read(X).
Assume that increment operations lock the item in increment mode using the compatibility matrix in Figure 18.25.
