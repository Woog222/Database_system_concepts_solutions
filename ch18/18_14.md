### 18.14

Suppose that we use the tree protocol of Section 18.1.5 to manage concurrent
access to a B+-tree. Since a split may occur on an insert that affects the root, it
appears that an insert operation cannot release any locks until it has completed
the entire operation. Under what circumstances is it possible to release a lock
earlier?

---

When moving down from the root, if the child node of the current node is not full, release the locks after acquiring the XLOCK on that child.
