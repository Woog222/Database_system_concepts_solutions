### 18.1

Show that the two-phase locking protocol ensures conflict serializability and that transactions can be serialized according to their lock points.

---

Let $\alpha_i$ denote the lock point of $T_i$.

#### Serializability

Suppose there exists a non-conflict serializable schdule $S$, which contains a cycle $(T_1, .. , T_n)$ in the precedence graph of $S$. By definition, $\alpha_1 < \alpha_2 < .. < \alpha_n < \alpha_1$. It's contradiction.

#### Lock point ordering

$\forall \  T_i, \  T_j \text{ s.t. } T_i \rightarrow T_j, \ \alpha_i < \alpha_j $

Once we sort the transactions by the order of their lock points, we obtain one of the topologically sorted orderings of the precedence graph of $S$. This ordering satisfies all precedence relations due to the statement above. Therefore, it represents one of the possible serial orders that is conflict-equivalent to schedule $S$.
