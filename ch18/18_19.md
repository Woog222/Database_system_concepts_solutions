### 18.19

Consider a variant of the tree protocol called the forest protocol. The database
is organized as a forest of rooted trees. Each transaction Ti must follow the
following rules:

+ The first lock in each tree may be on any data item.  
+ The second, and all subsequent, locks in a tree may be requested only if
the parent of the requested node is currently locked.    
+ Data items may be unlocked at any time.  
+ A data item may not be relocked by Ti after it has been unlocked by Ti.

Show that the forest protocol does not ensure serializability.
