### 18.12

Consider the timestamp-ordering protocol, and two transactions, one that writes two data items $p$ and $q$, and another that reads the same two data items. Give a schedule whereby the timestamp test for a write operation fails and causes the first transaction to be restarted, in turn causing a cascading abort of the other trasaction. Show how this could result in starvation of both transactions. (Such a situation, where two or more processes carry out actions, but are unable to complete their task because of interaction with the other pro-
cesses, is called a **livelock**.)
