### 18.6

Locking is not done explicitly in persistent programming languages. Rather,
objects (or the corresponding pages) must be locked when the objects are ac-
cessed. Most modern operating systems allow the user to set access protections
(no access, read, write) on pages, and memory access that violate the access
protections result in a protection violation (see the Unix mprotect command,
for example). Describe how the access-protection mechanism can be used for
page-level locking in a persistent programming language.
