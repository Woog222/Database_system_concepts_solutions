The multiple-granularity protocol rules specify that a transaction $T_i$ can lock a
node $Q$ in S or IS mode only if $T_i$ currently has the parent of $Q$ locked in either IX or IS mode. Given that SIX and S locks are stronger than IX or IS locks, why does the protocol not allow locking a node in S or IS mode if the parent is locked in either SIX or S mode?
