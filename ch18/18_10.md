### 18.10

For each of the following protocols, describe aspects of practical applications
that would lead you to suggest using the protocol, and aspects that would sug-
gest not using the protocol:

---

+ **Two-phase locking**: Simple applications where no granularity hierarchy is needed.

+ **Two-phase with multiple granularity**: Used when locking hierarchy is necessary.

+ **The tree protocol**: Applied when access order relationships are defined.

+ **Timestamp**: Used to prevent deadlock.


+ **Multiversion timestamp ordering**, **Multiversion two-phase locking**, **Validation** : Applied when conflicts are rare and read operations are frequent.

+ Multiversion two-phase locking: Used when conflicts are infrequent and read operations are dominant.
