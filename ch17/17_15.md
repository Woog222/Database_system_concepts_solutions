Consider the following two transactions
![alt text](image-2.png)
Let the consistency requirement be $A=0 \vee B=0$, with $A=B=0$ as the initial values.

----
#### a. Show that every serial execution involving these two transactions preserves the consistency of the database.

Easy


#### b. Show a concurrent execution of $T_{13}$ and $T_{14}$ that produces a nonserializable schedule.
| $T_{13}$       | $T_{14}$       |
|----------------|----------------|
| ```READ(A)```  | ```READ(B)```  |
| ```READ(B)```  | ```READ(A)```  |
|                |                |
| ```B=1```      |                |
| ```WRITE(B)``` |                |
|                | ```A=1```      |
|                | ```WRITE(A)``` |
|                |                |



#### c. Is there a concurrent execution of $T_{13}$ and $T_{14}$ that produces a serializable schedule?

Impossible. For any serializable schedule, the result must be either ```(A,B)=(1,0)``` or ```(A,B)=(0,1)```.

Without Loss of Generality, Let's assume that the $T_{13}$ started its execution first. By the time it reads the initial value of ```A=0```, no matter how the remaining operations are scheduled, the final value of ```B``` that is to be written out is ```1```. 

For this schedule to be serializable, ```A=0``` have to be written out, which means that the value of ```B``` that will be read by $T_{14}$ has to be ```1```. It means that this schedule has to be serial, non-concurrent.

It's impossible. In any serializable schedule, the result must either be ```(A,B) = (1,0)``` or ```(A,B) = (0,1)```.

Without loss of generality, assume transaction $T_{13}$ starts first. When $T_{13}$ reads the initial value ```A = 0```, regardless of subsequent scheduling, it will eventually write ```B = 1```.

For this schedule to be serializable, the initial value ```A = 0``` must be committed, meaning that  transaction $T_{14}$ must read ```B = 1```. Thus, this schedule must be serialized and non-concurrent
