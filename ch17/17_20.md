### 17.20

For each of the following isolation levels, give an example of a schedule that respects that specified level of isolation but is not serializable

---


#### a. Read uncommitted
| $T_{1}$  | $T_{2}$  |
|----------|----------|
| ```READ(A)```  |          |
|          | ```READ(A)```  |
|          | ```WRITE(A)``` |
| ```READ(A)```  |          |
| ```COMMIT```   |          |
|          | ```COMMIT```   |

#### b. Read committed
| $T_1$         | $T_2$          |
|---------------|----------------|
| ```READ(A)``` |                |
|               | ```READ(A)```  |
|               | ```WRITE(A)``` |
|               | ```COMMIT```   |
| ```READ(A)``` |                |
| ```COMMIT```  |                |

#### c. Repeatable Read


```SQL
-- A
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM r
WHERE salary > 1000

-- B
INSERT INTO r
VALUES (.., salary = 2000, ..)
```

$T_1$ performs the ```A``` operation twice within the same transaction.

$T_2$ performs the ```B``` operation in between the two ```A``` operations of $T_1$.

Since $T_1$ and $T_2$ do not operate on the same data, this concurrent schedule is allowed. However, the result of the ```A``` operations will be different, indicating that this schedule is non-serializable.

(This phenomenon is known as a **phantom phenomenon**.)
