### 17.21

Suppose that in addition to the operations ```read``` and ```write```, we allow an operation ```pred_read(r, P)``` which reads all tuples in relation $r$ that satisify predicate $P$.

---

#### a. Give an example of a schedule using the ```pred_read``` operation that exhibits the phantom phenomenon and is nonserializable as a result.

See Excercise 17.20.c

#### b. Give an example of a schedule where one transaction uses the ```pred_read``` operatoin on relation $r$ and another concurrent transaction deletes a tuple from $r$, but the schedule does not exhibit a phantom conflict. (To do so, you have to give the schema of relation $r$ and show the attribute values of the deleted tuple.)

It's possible when the deleted tuple does not satisfy the predicate $P$.
