Explain the distinction between the terms <i>serial schedule</i> and <i>serializable schedule</i>.

---

A *serial schedule* is a schedule where the operations of transactions do not interleave.

A *serializable schedule* is a schedule that leads to a result equivalent to that of a *serial schedule*.

We need to define the term <b>same result</b> strictly. There are several types of serializability, such as view serializability and conflict serializability, each based on different definitions of the <b>same result</b>.
