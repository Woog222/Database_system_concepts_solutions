### 5.5

Show how to enforce the constraint "an instructor cannot teach two different sections in a semester in the same time slot." using a trigger (remember that the constraint can be violated by changes to the teaches relation as well as to to the section relation).


```SQL
CREATE TRIGGER temp_name BEFORE INSERT ON teaches
REFERENCING NEW ROW AS nrow
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN nrow.(
    SELECT
    FROM teaches NATURAL JOIN section
    WHERE teaches.ID = nrow.ID
)
```
