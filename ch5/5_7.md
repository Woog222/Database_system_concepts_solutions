### 5.7

Consider the bank database of Figure 5.21. Write an SQL trigger to carry out the following action: On delete of an account, for each customer-owner of the account, check if the owner has any remaining accounts, and if she does not, delete her from the depositor relation.

```SQL
CREATE TRIGGER del_account AFTER DELETE ON account
REFERENCING OLD ROW AS orow
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM depositor
    WHERE depositor.customer_name NOT IN (
        SELECT customer_name
        FROM depositor
        WHERE account_number <> orow.account_number
    )
END

```
