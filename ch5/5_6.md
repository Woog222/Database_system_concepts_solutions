### 5.6

Consider the bank database of Figure 5.21. Let us define a view branch_cust as follows:

```SQL
CREATE VIEW branch_cust AS 
    SELECT branch_name, customer_name
    FROM depositor, account
    WHERE depositor.account_number = account.account_number

```    
Suppose that the view is *materialized*; that is, the view is computed and stored. Write triggers to *maintain* the view, that is, to keep it up-to-date on insertions to *depositor* or *account*. It is not necessary to handle deltions or updates. Note that, for simplicity, we have not required elimination of duplicates.

---

```SQL
CREATE TRIGGER dep_insert AFTER INSERT ON depositor
REFERENCING NEW ROW AS nrow
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO branch_cust
    SELECT branch_name , nrow.customer_name
    FROM account
    WHERE account_number = nrow.account_number
END

/*
This trigger is included in the official solution given by the author, but I believe this trigger is unnecessary. 
Because of the foreign key integrity from `depositor` (`account_number`) to `account` (`account_number`), any insertion into the `depositor` relation requires a corresponding tuple to exist in the `account` relation beforehand. Therefore, it might be sufficient to have only the trigger above without the one below.
*/

CREATE TRIGGER insert_into_branch_cust_via_account
AFTER INSERT ON account
REFERENCING NEW ROW AS inserted
FOR EACH STATEMENT
INSERT INTO branch_cust
    SELECT inserted.branch_name,customer_name
    FROM depositor
    WHERE depositor.account_number = inserted.account_number;

```
